Welcome to the opensource repository for qt-training material !

================================
Building the Presentations (PDF)
================================

Prequisites
===========

The training slides are produced in Latex. The resulting PDF files can
be displayed with any PDF viewer. On Ubuntu/Debian systems you have to
install the following packages:

apt-get install texlive-science texlive-pictures
apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-formats-extra
apt-get install latex-beamer pdfjam transfig graphicsmagick

Compile your own course works using 'tm_builder.py'
===================================================

The 'tm_builder.py' script is specifically designed for the needs
of trainers. It builds your selection of modules and places these together
with associated example programs into a single output directory.

The 'tm_builder.py' is run from the command line passing a course description
file written in Python. You find both the 'tm_builder.py' and an example
course description ('example_course.py') in the 'scripts' subfolder with
further information how to create your own course files.

The standard course works reside in the 'course' subfolder.
Enter the directory and enter the following commands to build a course:

../scripts/tm_builder.py qtquick.py

====================
Contributing Changes
====================

Once you have up a working Latex setup check out the "Contributors Guide".
You can build it from the 'slides' subfolder:

cd slides
pdflatex contributors-guide/contributors-guide.tex
