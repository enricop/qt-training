Welcome to the opensource repository for qt-training material !

================================
Building the Presentations (PDF)
================================

Prequisites
===========

The training slides are produced in Latex. The resulting PDF files can
be displayed with any PDF viewer. On Ubuntu/Debian systems you have to
install the following packages:

apt-get install texlive-science texlive-pictures
apt-get install texlive-latex-extra texlive-formats-extra
apt-get install latex-beamer pdfjam transfig graphicsmagick

Build standard course works using 'pdflatex'
===========================================

After cloning the training sources enter the 'slides' subdirectory.
From there you can build standard course works using 'pdflatex':

cd slides
pdflatex course/qt-essentials.tex
# run a second time to include the table of contents

Compile your own course works using 'tm_builder.py'
===================================================

The 'tm_builder.py' script is specifically designed for the needs
of trainers. It builds your selection of modules and places these together
with associated example programs into a single output directory.

The 'tm_builder.py' is run from the command line passing a course description
file written in Python. You find both the 'tm_builder.py' and an example
course description ('example_course.py') in the 'scripts' subfolder with
further information how to create your own course files.

Example:

# edit example_course.py
cd scripts
./tm_builder.py -d example_course.py # dry-run
./tm_builder.py example_course.py    # actually build PDF files

Check out the builtin help for further information:

./tm_builder -h

====================
Contributing Changes
====================

Once you have up a working Latex setup check out the "Contributors Guide".
You can build it from the 'slides' subfolder:

cd slides
pdflatex contributors-guide/contributors-guide.tex
