TODO:
  qprocess, inter process communication, sockets, Network Programming
  QtTestLib and unit-based test cases. Show some tests in the qt src tree
    data-driven tests
    simulating GUI events
  Drag-n-Drop
    (there is modelview and graphicsview dnd - but we need slides on the basics, mimetypes and mimedata)
  Multimedia
  Event handling
    (advanced events, such as creating events, posting vs sending, event filters, etc),
  signal mapper example - show modelview/libobjectbrowser example
  deleteLater(), qDeleteAll()
  qtimer
  QImage vs QPixmap vs QIcon
    QStyle::standardIcon() vs QIcon::fromTheme()
  modelview - add a lab step for the cityengine for implementing the filter
    delegates and itemfactory - show different-typed standard items
    mention the qt modeltest which is now included in the qt 5.2 src under qtbase/tests/auto/other/modeltest
  graphicsview - add another example using QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsLayoutItem
    Drop on an item: Replace the DiagramScene:: method with the correct dropEvent() method from DiagramItem
    dnd example: don't store pointers as qlonglong - use something else that allows for cross-app dnd
  threads:
    Slide 20: simpler subclassing example needed that does not use mutex or waitcondition
    slide 33: s/QMutex/QSemaphore
    Move QRunnable slides until after we talk about QThread
    Clarify slide 19: "Note: Don't pass pointers that you do not own"
      Don't pass pointers at all, if you can avoid it!
    Slide 22: "Event driven objects may only be used in a single thread"
      this slide needs to be rewritten
