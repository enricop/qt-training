TODO:
  Event handling
    (advanced events, such as creating events, posting vs sending, event filters, etc),
  objects: deleteLater(), qDeleteAll(), qtimer, qtimeline?
    signal mapper example - show modelview/libobjectbrowser example
  QtTestLib and unit-based test cases. Show some tests in the qt src tree
    data-driven tests
    simulating GUI events
    model tester is now a proper unit test.
  qprocess, inter process communication, sockets, Network Programming
  Drag-n-Drop
    (there is modelview and graphicsview dnd - but we need slides on the basics, mimetypes and mimedata)
  Multimedia
  Painting: QImage vs QPixmap vs QIcon
    QStyle::standardIcon() vs QIcon::fromTheme()
  modelview - add a lab step for the cityengine for implementing the filter
    new slide on extending QStyledItemDelegate before showing the ex-bargraphdelegate
    mention the qt modeltest which is now included in the qt 5.2 src under qtbase/tests/auto/other/modeltest
    widgetmodel can be rewritten to use libobjectbrowser
  graphicsview - Need another example using QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsLayoutItem
    new slide on QPainterPath. Show how to compose 2 QPainterPaths from ex-pendulum for extending QGraphicsItemGroup
    rewrite ex-dragdrop: don't store pointers as qlonglong - use typeid and factory method for cross-app dnd.
  threads:
    Slide 19: Clarify "Note: Don't pass pointers that you do not own"
      Don't pass pointers at all, if you can avoid it!
    Slide 20: simpler subclassing example needed that does not use mutex or waitcondition
    Slide 22: "Event driven objects may only be used in a single thread" this slide needs to be rewritten
    Move QRunnable slides until after we talk about QThread
