TODO:

  Network Programming
  Drag-n-Drop
    (there is modelview and graphicsview dnd - but we need slides on mimetypes and mimedata, and the dnd basics),
  Multimedia
  Event handling
    (advanced events, such as creating events, posting vs sending, event filters, etc),
  signal mapper
  qtimer
  qprocess
  QImage vs QPixmap vs QIcon
  
  standard pixmaps from the theme, standard icons from the style

  modelview - add a lab step for the cityengine for implementing the filter
  	
  graphicsview - add another example using QGraphicsWidget and
  QGraphicsLayoutItem
  
  graphicsview -investigate why the pendulum example's bounding rect is not correct 
  
Drop on an item: Replace the DiagramScene:: method with the correct
dropEvent() method from DiagramItem

threads slide 33: s/QMutex/QSemaphore

Move QRunnable slides until after we talk about QThread

Clarify slide 19: "Note: Don't pass pointers that you do not own"
	Don't pass pointers at all, if you can avoid it!

Slide 22: "Event driven objects may only be used in a single thread"
	this slide needs to be rewritten
	
Slide 20: simpler subclassing example needed that does not use mutex or waitcondition

sol-prime-runnable - get rid of autoDelete() and delete the runnables yourself. 

graphicsview dnd example: don't store pointers as qlonglong - use something else that allows
for cross-app dnd

sol-prime-runnable - get rid of autodelete
