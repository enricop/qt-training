(: FLOWR example to select all albums for which the arist name ends with 'Lennon',
and create a new XML with the album title and release year :)
 let $doc := doc('collection.xml')
 for $a in $doc//album,
     $s in $doc//artists/artist
 where ends-with($s, 'Lennon')
     and $a/artistRef = $s/@id
 order by $a/year
 return
  <album name='{$a/title}' year='{$a/year}'/>
