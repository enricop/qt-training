\begin{slide}{1790}\frametitle{Objectives}

\vspace*{1em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge on how to create items with your own painting code
\item Use canvas with user interaction of animations
\item Create a complete particle system
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Specify the particles
  \item Provide speed, acceleration or other physics traits
  \end{itemize}
\item Use shaders to modify items rendering
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fragment shaders for pixel manipulation
  \item Vertex shaders for shape manipulation
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
