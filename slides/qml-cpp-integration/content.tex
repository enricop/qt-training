%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide}{1577}\frametitle{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item The QML runtime environment
  \begin{itemize}
  \item understanding of the basic architecture
  \item ability to set up QML in a C++ application
  \end{itemize}
\item Exposing C++ objects to QML
  \begin{itemize}
  \item knowledge of the Qt features that can be exposed
  \item familiarity with the mechanisms used to expose objects
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\flushedImage{qml-cpp-integration/images/chat.png}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The handout contains a partial solution\\
    for a small chat program.
  \item One side of the chat will be a server\\
    (using QTcpServer) and the other end\\
    connect to it.
  \item The TCP communication is already\\
    implemented in C++
  \item The GUI is implemented in QML
  \item Missing: Is the glue which makes the two parts work together.
  \item \textbf{STEPS} are available in the file readme.txt.
  \end{itemize}
