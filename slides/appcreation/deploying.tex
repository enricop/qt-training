\subsection{Deploying Qt Applications}

\begin{slide}{1771}
  \frametitle{Ways of Deploying}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Static Linking
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Results in stand-alone executable
    \item $+$ Only few files to deploy
    \item $-$ Executables are large
    \item $-$ No flexibility
    \item $-$ You cannot deploy plugins
    \end{itemize}
  \item Shared Libraries
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $+$ Can deploy plugins
    \item $+$ Qt libs shared between applications
    \item $+$ Smaller, more flexible executables
    \item $-$ More files to deploy
    \end{itemize}
  \item Qt is by default compiled as shared library
  \item If Qt is pre-installed on system
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use shared libraries approach
    \end{itemize}
  \item \doc{deployment.html}{Deploying Qt Applications}
 \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{1770}
  \frametitle{Deployment}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Shared Library Version
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If Qt is not a system library
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Need to redistribute Qt libs with application
      \end{itemize}
    \item Minimal deployment
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Libraries used by application
      \item Plugins used by Qt
      \end{itemize}
    \item Ensure Qt libraries use correct path to find Qt plugins
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[] \doc{qt-conf.html}{Using qt.conf}
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}
  \item Static Linkage Version
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Build Qt statically
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$QTDIR/configure -static <your other options>}
      \item Specify required options (e.g. sql drivers)
      \end{itemize}
    \item Link application against Qt
    \item Check that application runs stand-alone
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Copy application to machine without Qt and run it
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
